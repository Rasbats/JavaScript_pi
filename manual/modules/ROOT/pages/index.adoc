= Javascript Plugin

== Aim

To provide a plugin that allows users to write scripts that extend the
functioning of OpenCPN without getting into the complexity of writing a
plugin.

== How does it work?

The plugin provides one or more console windows comprising a script pane, a
results pane and some buttons. You enter your JavaScript in the script
pane (or load it from a file) and click on the Run button. The script is
compiled into byte code and executed and any result is displayed. At its
simplest, enter, say

----
print("Hello from OpenCPN\n");
----

When you click on the Run button, the message will be displayed.  (The \n bit adds a new line to the end of the message.)

The plugin extends JavaScript to add many interfaces to OpenCPN and it is here that the fun starts.
As an example, the following statement takes the supplied NMEA sentence, adds a checksum (replacing any existing one) and
pushes it out over the OpenCPN connections:

----
OCPNpushNMEA(“$OCRMB,A,0.000,L,,Yarmouth,5030.530,N,00120.030,W,
       15.386,82.924,0.000,5030.530,S,00120.030,E,V");
----

It is also possible to arrrange for a JavaScript function to be executed on a given NMEA event. 
For example
----
OCPNonNMEAsentence(handleNMEA);

function handleNMEA(result){
    if(result.OK){
    print(“Received: “, result.value, “\n”);
        }
    else print(“Bad checksum\n”);
    }
----

This listens out for the next NMEA sentence and displays it on receipt
if the checksum is OK.
