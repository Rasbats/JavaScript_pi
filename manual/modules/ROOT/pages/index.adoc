= Javascript Plugin

== JavaScript

== Aim

To provide a scriptable plugin that allows users to tailor the
functioning of OpenCPN without getting into the complexity of writing a
plugin.

== How does it work?

The plugin provides one or more console windows comprising a script pane, a
results pane and some buttons. You enter your JavaScript in the script
pane (or load it from a file) and click on the Run button. The script is
compiled into byte code and executed and any result is displayed. At its
simplest, enter, say

----
print("Hello from OpenCPN\n");
----

When you click on the Run button, the message will be displayed.  (The \n bit adds a new line to the end of the message.)and the result 4 is displayed.

The plugin adds many interfaces to OpenCPN and it is here that
the fun starts. As an example, the following statement takes the
supplied NMEA sentence, adds a checksum (replacing any existing one) and
pushes it out over the OpenCPN connections

----
OCPNpushNMEA(“$OCRMB,A,0.000,L,,Yarmouth,5030.530,N,00120.030,W,
       15.386,82.924,0.000,5030.530,S,00120.030,E,V");
----

It is also possible to set a JavaScript function to be executed on a given NMEA event. 
For example
----
OCPNonNMEAsentence(handleNMEA);

function handleNMEA(result){
    if(result.OK){
    print(“Received: “, result.value, “\n”);
        }
    else print(“Bad checksum\n”);
    }
----

This listens out for the next NMEA sentence and displays it on receipt
if the checksum is OK.
