README Linux installation

Install with gdebi rather than the Ubuntu installer.

The Ubuntu installer fails to install the plugin icons nor the scripts library.
If you must use the Ubuntu installer, you will need to copy the data folder from the source into
SharedSupport/plugins/JavaScript_pi within the OpenCPN application.
